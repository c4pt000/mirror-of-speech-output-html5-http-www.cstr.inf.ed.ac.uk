<br><a name="WhatIsTTS"><h2>What is all this "synthetic speech", TTS, speech
   synthesis etc...?</h2></a>

Synthetic speech is speech which has been produced by some artificial
means (e.g. by computer software or some mechanical device) rather than by a real
human.  
<br>
Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS for short) is any system which takes
text input and converts it automatically into audible speech, using
any of the many speech synthesis methods.

<br><a name="FestivalInfo"><h2>Where can I find out more about
Festival?</h2><a>

A good place to start for further information is the <a
href="index.html">Festival project
page</a>.

<br><a name="TTSInfo"><h2>Where can I find out more about
speech synthesis?</h2><a>

Although not authoratitive, Wikipedia has a page on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech
synthesis</a>, which is instantly accessible and covers many aspects
for the layperson.  Another starting place is the <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/comp.speech/">comp.speech 
Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.

<br><br><a name="HowToUseDemo"><h2>How do I make this demo work?</h2></a>

There are three simple steps to using this demo:

<ul>
    <li> First, select one of the voices offered in the first drop-down list.
    <li> Then, type in the short text you want to hear synthesised (max 70
    chars)
    <li> Either click the "Say it!" button, or on some browsers
    just hit return, to send your request to the synthesiser!
</ul>


<br><a name="Problems"><h2>I've done that but it still doesn't
work!</h2></a>

There are several possible causes:

<ul>
    <li> It might just be <a href="#Speed">taking longer</a> than you expect. Try waiting a
    few seconds to see if that solves your problem ;)

    <li> Your computer/browser may not be set up to play sound.  Try
    clicking on <a href="testwave.wav">this sound</a>.  If you can't
    hear that, you may well have a problem playing audio at your end.

    <li> There may be a problem with our server.  Please let us know
    by mailing <script language=javascript>
        <!--
         var a = "tts-demo"
         var b = "cstr.ed.ac.uk"
         document.write("<a href="+"mail"+"to"+":"+a+"&#64;"+b+">"
                         +"tts-demo&#64;"+b+"</a>")
         //-->
    </script>

</ul>


<br><a name="Overuse"><h2>I've just been using the demo, but
   now it suddenly doesn't work - why is that?</h2></a>

Unfortunately, due to a few cases of abuse of this web demo, we have
had to implement a cap on the number of synthesis requests which can
occur in a certain time period.  We've tried to set this high enough
so that it doesn't interfere with legitimate use of the demo (i.e. by
a human!).  However, if you find you've been really engrossed in
listening to synthetic speech samples and have used up your quota of
requests and the demo no longer works, then just leave it a while and 
try again. If it doesn't work again after a few hours then please
report this.

<br><a name="Speed"><h2>Why does it take so long?</h2></a>

Speech synthesis can be computationally expensive, depending on which
voice is selected. If several people are trying to use the demo at
once, things will slow down too.  We only have limited resources to
dedicate to this demo after all!  There may also be delays in sending
the synthetic speech over the internet to you (especially if you have
a slow connection to the internet). Finally, we are currently
investigating random delays which sometimes occur in our own network,
which sometimes slows down data transfer to and from the machine which
actually does the synthesis here.

<br><a name="usage"><h2>Usage - how can this demo be used?</h2></a>

<p>
We provide this as an interactive demonstration of speech synthesis in
Festival <b>only</b>.  It should not be considered or used in any way
as a "free service", e.g. using the underlying CGI scripts themselves,
or access by any sort of automatic script is <b>not</b> permitted.  On
the other hand, if you are a human and you type in a bunch of short
sentences to the web form to hear how the synthetic speech sounds,
then that is perfectly fine.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the synthetic speech produced is meant for <b>personal,
non-commercial use only</b>.  Using the synthetic speech for anything
else than purely listening to it as a standalone audio file is not
permitted.  
</p>

<p>
If you are in any doubt whether what you want to do with this is
acceptable or not, then please mail <script language=javascript>
        <!--
         var a = "tts-demo"
         var b = "cstr.ed.ac.uk"
         document.write("<a href="+"mail"+"to"+":"+a+"&#64;"+b+">"
                         +"tts-demo&#64;"+b+"</a>")
         //-->
    </script>
    to ask!
</p>

<br><a name="voices"><h2>I really like your demo, where can I download
voice XYZ?</h2></a>

<p>
Since posting this demo we've been getting more and more mails asking
where to find downloads for the voices featured to match the freely
available Festival synthesis system itself.  
</p>

<p>
In fact, we have previously made some of these voices available on a
one-off basis to several commercial parties who have approached us.
However, very few of the voices in this demo are currently publicly
available directly as a download (whether for non-commercial or
commercial use).
</p>

<p>
The good news, though, is that we're currently putting together a
portfolio of <b>dozens and dozens</b> (really!) of voices which
<b>will be available to download</b> shortly.  Some voices will be
available for commercial use only, some for non-commercial use only,
and indeed some for both.  We envisage all the voices currently on the
demo will be available, with the addition of many more.  When these
are ready, we'll put a link in the demo itself, amongst other things.

<p> In the meantime, if you'd like to discuss commercial licensing in
a hurry, or would like to be notified when commercial voices become
available, then please mail 
<script language=javascript>

//--> 
</script>.
</p>

<br><a name="features"><h2>I love demo voice X and downloaded one
   with a similar name from Y. Why doesn't it sound the same as
   on the demo?</h2></a>

<p>
The system running on our demo page typically uses cutting-edge
developments resulting from our most recent research.  These features
may not have made it to the free public releases yet. See the answer
to the previous frequently asked question for more details.
